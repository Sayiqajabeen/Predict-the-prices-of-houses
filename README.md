# Predict-the-prices-of-houses
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Linear regression model using Python's scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

Data Generation:
Generate synthetic data for square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms, as well as house prices based on a simple linear relationship.
Data Splitting:
Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Model Training:
Use the LinearRegression model from scikit-learn to fit the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics to assess its accuracy.
